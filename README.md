# AuthenLens AI Detection System

AuthenLens is an advanced AI-generated content detection system that can analyze images, videos, audio, and text to determine if they are AI-generated or human-created.

## Image Model

The image detection model uses a dual-input architecture that analyzes both the original image and its Error Level Analysis (ELA) version:

1. **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**: This technique reveals differences in JPEG compression levels, which can help identify areas that may have been modified or generated by AI.

2. **Dual-Input Neural Network**: The model uses both the original image and the ELA image as inputs to a deep learning model based on EfficientNetV2B0/ResNet50V2.

3. **Feature Extraction**: The neural network extracts features from both images, concatenates them, and processes them through additional layers to make a final prediction.

4. **Output**: The model outputs a probability score indicating how likely the image is to be AI-generated.

## How to Use

1. Select the media type you want to analyze (Image, Video, Audio, or Text)
2. Upload your file or paste your text
3. Click "Analyze" to process the content
4. View the detailed results showing the probability of AI generation

## Model Integration

The application uses TensorFlow.js to load and run the trained h5 models in the browser. The models are loaded from the server and cached in IndexedDB for faster subsequent access.

## Setup

To use the application with your own models:

1. Place your h5 model files in the `/public/models/` directory with the following names:
   - `image_detection_model.h5`
   - `video_detection_model.h5`
   - `audio_detection_model.h5`
   - `text_detection_model.h5`

2. Run the application and start analyzing content
